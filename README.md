OSGi enRoute</h1>

## Notice
The OSGi Alliance is working towards the release of the R7 version of the OSGi specifications. enRoute will be updated to align it with R7 so please expect changes to the examples and website content. The current enRoute website content and repos will be deprecated, though they will remain available for the foreseeable future,

Migration guidance will be provided for users with current enRoute based applications and systems. Please e-mail any questions to the developer mailing list (osgi-dev@mail.osgi.org) or in confidence to help@osgi.org.


## enRoute
[OSGi enRoute][enroute] provides a simple on-ramp for developing modular distributed applications and exploring the potential of OSGi to deliver truly agile & maintainable Enterprise / Cloud or highly distributed Edge IoT solutions.

Based upon latest OSGi best practices and R7 Specifications, the enRoute tutorials start with a comprehensive hands-on introduction to Declarative Services, and then progress to explore OSGi's unique and powerful approaches to Microservices & Reactive Systems.

This repository contains the code for the enRoute tutorials, and also defines useful OSGi repositories for the OSGi R7 reference implementations. You can use these repositories directly in your own OSGi applications, or as a template for creating your own personalised OSGi application runtime.
