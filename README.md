OSGi enRoute</h1>

Interested in developing agile & maintainable Enterprise or highly distributed IoT solutions? In either case, [OSGi enRoute][enroute] provides a simple on-ramp for developing such modular distributed applications and exploring the power of OSGi. 

Based upon latest OSGi best practices and R7 Specifications, the enRoute tutorials start with a comprehensive hands-on introduction to Declarative Services, and then progresses to explore OSGi's unique and powerful approaches to Microservices & Reactive Systems.

This repository contains the code for the enRoute tutorials, and also defines useful OSGi repositories for the OSGi R7 reference implementations. You can use these repositories directly in your own OSGi applications, or as a template for creating your own personalised OSGi application runtime.
